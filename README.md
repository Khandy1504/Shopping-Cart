# Shopping-Cart
 This is a shopping cart application that allows the user to add and remove things from their cart. It can add multiples of an itam, apply a valid discount code, or even display all items in the cart. It stores the user's name and date of purchases. It can print a description of items, print out the total of the customer's cart and implements a user friendly menu for the user to access all of these function. 

This application taught me how to write code in Python, the use of construstors, and how to manage a larger amount of methods.
